<h1 align="center">Survey: Additional education for children </a>  

###

Additional education for children is aimed at developing creative abilities and professional orientation, as well as identifying and supporting children who have shown outstanding abilities. However, often parents take into account only their own opinion in choosing the direction of additional education, thus neglecting the potential of their children. The idea of the survey is to find out what motivates parents in choosing additional education classes.
